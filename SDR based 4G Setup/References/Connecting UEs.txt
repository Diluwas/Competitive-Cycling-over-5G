# You need a mobile phone that supports that cumucore sim card.
  Most of mobile phones may support that. But iphones do not

Steps

1. Insert the sim card
2. The phone automatically might get connected to the USRP B210 device
   If does not, go the mobile-->mobile networks[something like that through the settings]. Then you will see a related network name
